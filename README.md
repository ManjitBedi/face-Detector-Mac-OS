The code is hacked from an iOS sample code from Apple with support added to upload images to Firebase.   

[Tracking the Userâ€™s Face in Real Time](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/tracking_the_user_s_face_in_real_time)

The Firebase support is achieved using  community Firebase code & Cocoapods.

The code was orginally intended to be used in an art installation piece but the app was crashing in the Vision Framework - it went pear shaped for various reasons.  The code was hacked to work around the crash issue but this changed the desired behaviour of the app.  

In various places, the app will do some scaling & image compositing.  This code would benefit from re-factoring.
